.SYNOPSIS
  Boot WSL2 machine with fixed IP.
.DESCRIPTION
  - This script create or recreate the WSL network on Windows side,
    and updates the WSL machine with the pre-defined static IP on Linux side.
  - This script manages other Hyper-V VMs connected to WSL network too.
  - This script also starts few Linux services (sshd).
.NOTES
  - This script must Run As Administrator from a Windows PowerShell prompt,
    or from the bat file executed with elevated permission (Run As Administrator).
  - Any WSL command starts the WSL machine if not started already, and
    creates the NetAdapter 'vEthernet (WSL)' if it does not exist already (Windows deletes it on Windows power down).
    However this script creates the NetAdapter first, so WSL will re-use it.
  - The command /boot/wsl-boot.sh updates the primary ip addr on Linux side, and starts few Linux services.
  - Windows assigns the correct DNS nameserver if everything happened in the correct order
    i.e. WSL2 lightweight utility virtual machine is down and all Hyper-V VMs using WSL VMSwitch are down too
    before WSL network is recreated.
  - The DNS resolution works in any situation however you are connected to Internet, and with or without VPN.
  Note: You should connect all VMs in Hyper-V to the VMSwitch 'WSL' too.
